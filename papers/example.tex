% The \documentclass{} macro specifies the overall style. For computer
% networking papers, common options are:
%
%   \documentclass[twocolumn,a4paper]{article}  % Base LaTeX style
%   \documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}        % IEEE Conference
%   \documentclass[10pt,sigconf]{acmart}        % ACM SIGCOMM conference
%
% The IEEE and ACM templates are included in the lib/tex/inputs directory,
% but check for updates and use the version specified by the conference or
% journal to which you're submitting.

\documentclass[10pt,sigconf]{acmart}

% The following packages are recommended, and should be available in most
% standard LaTeX installations (or from https://www.ctan.org/). Note that 
% the order in which packages are loaded is significant.

% Basic extensions recommended for all LaTeX documents:
%   nag        Warn about common problems with LaTeX files
%   inputenc   Specify the character set used in .tex files
%   babel      Language-specific typography and hyphenation
%   microtype  Improved typography when generating PDF files

% The AMS mathematics library greatly extends and improves mathematics
% support in LaTeX (see http://ctan.org/pkg/amsmath for details). When
%  preparing multi-line numbered equations, be sure to use:
%
%   \begin{align}
%     ...
%   \end{align} 
%
% rather than:
%
%   \begin{eqnarray}
%     ...
%   \end{eqnarray}.  
%
% when this package is loaded, to ensure they formatting is consistent
% (see https://tug.org/pracjourn/2006-4/madsen/madsen.pdf for details).

\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage[all]{onlyamsmath}

% Use Times, Helvetica, and Courier fonts, rather than Computer Modern:

\makeatletter
\@ifclassloaded{acmart}{
  % The ACM article style sets the fonts internally
}{
  \usepackage{newtxtext}
  \usepackage{newtxmath}
}
\makeatother

% Add support for sub-figures within a figure, as follows:
%
%   \begin{figure}
%     \centering
%     \subfloat[caption for 1st subfloat]{
%       \includegraphics{...}
%       \label{...}
%     }
%     \\
%     \subfloat[caption for 2nd subfloat]{
%       \includegraphics{...}
%       \label{...}
%     }
%     \caption{caption for entire figure}
%     \label{...}
%   \end{figure*}
%
% The subfig package obsoletes the older subfigure package, and is itself
% deprecated in favour of the subcaption package. However, as of April 2015
% subcaption doesn't work with ACM or IEEE style files (this is also the
% reason for the [caption=false] option).

\usepackage[caption=false]{subfig}

% Improve formatting of tables. To produce nice looking tables:
%
%   - avoid vertical lines;
%   - avoid double horizontal lines;
%   - use horizontal lines above and below the table, and to separate the
%     header from the body of the table, but not elsewhere; and
%   - if in doubt, align columns to the left (columns of numbers should
%     align to the decimal point)
%
% This translates to a tabular environment that looks something like the
% following:
%
%   \begin{tabular}{lll}
%     \toprule
%        Header1 & Header2 & Header3 \\
%     \midrule
%        Line1   & ...     & ...     \\
%        Line2   & ...     & ...     \\
%        Line3   & ...     & ...     \\
%        Line4   & ...     & ...     \\
%     \bottomrule
%   \end{tabular}

\usepackage{booktabs}

% Improve formatting for quote marks in verbatim mode:
\usepackage{upquote}

% Improve support for graphics:
\usepackage{graphicx}

% Add support for URLs using \url{...}. This formats the URL in typewriter
% font, and makes it a hyperlink if the hyperref package is also loaded.
\usepackage{url}

% Add support for drawing packet headers. For instructions, see
% http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/bytefield
\usepackage{bytefield}

% Add support for typesetting program source code. You can either include
% code in-line:
%
%   \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
%   Source code goes here
%   \end{lstlisting}
%
% or include a source file:
%
%  \lstinputlisting[language=Python]{source_filename.py}
%
% This package is highly customisable and supports a range of languages.
% See package documentation at https://ctan.org/pkg/listings for details.
\usepackage{listings}

% Generated PDF files can include hyperlinks for URLs and cross-references
% using the hyperref package. This package, however, can interact poorly
% with others. Known issues include:
%
%  - Papers typeset without page numbers gives warnings of the form:
%      "pdfTeX warning (ext4): destination with the same identifier 
%      (name{page.}) has been already used, duplicate ignored".
%    since hyperref tries to refer to the page number.
%  - The algorithmic package uses the same line-numbering scheme for each
%    algorithm, and can cause duplicate identifier warnings if you have
%    several algorithms with line numbers (this may have been fixed with 
%    recent versions of algorithmic...).
%  - If using the algorithm package with hyperref, you need to load packages
%    in the following order (see README in hyperref documentation):
%      \usepackage{float}
%      \usepackage{hyperref}
%      \usepackage{algorithm}
% For these reasons, hyperref is best to avoid for most papers, however if
% needed, uncomment the following two lines:
%  \usepackage{float}
%  \usepackage{hyperref}

% The algorithm package defines the algorithm environment. This is used in
% the same way as the figure and table environments, to include algorithms
% in a paper. The algpseudocode package provides the ability to typeset the
% algorithms: http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx
\usepackage{algorithm}
\usepackage{algpseudocode}
\usepackage{color}

% By default, LaTeX adds extra space after punctuation. The \frenchspacing
% command disables this. This creates tighter looking, more even, text and
% avoids inconsistencies if you forget to use '\ ' to suppress the spacing
% after in-sentence punctuation.
\frenchspacing

% Prevent hyphenation of all upper case words:
\uchyph=0

% The ACM style needs \maketitle after the abstract, but the other styles
% want it before; these macros hide the difference and are used below:
\makeatletter
\@ifclassloaded{acmart}{
  \newcommand{\maketitleSTD}{}
  \newcommand{\maketitleACM}{\maketitle}
}{
  \newcommand{\maketitleSTD}{\maketitle}
  \newcommand{\maketitleACM}{}
}
\makeatother

% Define a simple \todo{...} macro:
\newcommand{\todo}[1]{\textbf{\textcolor{red}{To do: #1}}}

%==================================================================================================

% Specify the title of the document:

\title{...}

% Specify the authors of the document. Unfortunately, there's no consistent
% way to do this that works across the different document classes.

\section{Introduction}

% A good paper introduction is fairly formulaic. If you follow a simple set
% of rules, you can write a very good introduction. The following outline can
% be varied. For example, you can use two paragraphs instead of one, or you
% can place more emphasis on one aspect of the intro than another. But in all
% cases, all of the points below need to be covered in an introduction, and
% in most papers, you don't need to cover anything more in an introduction.
%
% Paragraph 1: Motivation. At a high level, what is the problem area you
% are working in and why is it important? It is important to set the larger
% context here. Why is the problem of interest and importance to the larger
% community?



% Paragraph 2: What is the specific problem considered in this paper? This
% paragraph narrows down the topic area of the paper. In the first
% paragraph you have established general context and importance. Here you
% establish specific context and background.



% Paragraph 3: "In this paper, we show that...". This is the key paragraph
% in the introduction - you summarize, in one paragraph, what are the main
% contributions of your paper, given the context established in paragraphs 
% 1 and 2. What's the general approach taken? Why are the specific results
% significant? The story is not what you did, but rather:
%  - what you show, new ideas, new insights
%  - why interesting, important?
% State your contributions: these drive the entire paper.  Contributions
% should be refutable claims, not vague generic statements.

In this paper, we ...

% Paragraph 4: What are the differences between your work, and what others
% have done? Keep this at a high level, as you can refer to future sections
% where specific details and differences will be given, but it is important
% for the reader to know what is new about this work compared to other work
% in the area.



% Paragraph 5: "We structure the remainder of this paper as follows." Give
% the reader a road-map for the rest of the paper. Try to avoid redundant
% phrasing, "In Section 2, In section 3, ..., In Section 4, ... ", etc.

We structure the remainder of this paper as follows.

%==================================================================================================
% Concentrate single-mindedly on a narrative that:
%  - Describes the problem, and why it's interesting
%  - Describes your idea
%  - Defends your idea, showing how it solves the problem, and filling out
%    the details
% On the way, cite relevant work in passing, but defer discussion to the
% end.
%
% Introduce the problem, and your idea, using examples, and only then
% present the general case. Explain the idea as if your were speaking to
% someone using a whiteboard. Conveying the intuition is primary; details
% follow. Write in a top down manner: state broad themes and ideas first,
% then go into details.
%
% The introduction makes claims. The body of the paper provides evidence
% to support each claim. Check each claim in the introduction, identify
% the evidence, and forward-reference it from the claim. 
%==================================================================================================
\section{}

% The problem



%==================================================================================================
\section{}

% My idea



%==================================================================================================
\section{}

% The details

% Describe results carefully:
%  - clearly state assumptions
%  - give enough information to allow the reader to recreate the results
%  - ensure results are representative; statistically meaningful, etc.
%  - don't overstate results
%  - equally, don't understate them: consider the broader implications



%==================================================================================================
\section{Related Work}

% This should come near the end, and focussing on discussing how your work
% relates to that of others. Any relevant related work should have been
% cited already, so this is not a list of related work, it's a discussion
% of how that work relates.
%
% Why not put related work after the introduction? 1) because describing
% alternative approaches gets between the reader and your idea; and 2)
% because the reader knows nothing about the problem yet, so your
% (carefully trimmed) description of various technical trade-offs is
% absolutely incomprehensible.
% 
% When writing the related work:
%  - Give credit to others where it's due; this doesn't diminish the
%    credit you get from your paper. 
%  - Acknowledge weaknesses in your approach.
%  - Ensure related work is accurate and up-to-date
